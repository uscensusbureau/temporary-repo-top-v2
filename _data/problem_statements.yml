Youth Homelessness:
  Sprints: 2017 Sprint 1 (ED HUD VA)
  Full Title: Youth Homelessness
  Agency: U.S. Department of Education
  Challenge: National, state, and local policymakers, educators, and service agencies
    could benefit from better understanding where our homeless preK-12 students are
    enrolled and how well we are serving them.
  Background: 'Homelessness affects a growing number of students nationwide. The number
    of homeless students nationwide has nearly doubled from about 680 thousand homeless
    children and youths enrolled in public schools in 2006-07, to more than 1.3 million
    during the 2013-14 school year. Over the same period, the number of unaccompanied
    homeless youths (not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian) has more
    than doubled to nearly 100,000 students. Young children constitute a substantial
    proportion of children experiencing sheltered homelessness in families (about
    250,000 in total) – in FY 2015, about half of all such children were under age
    6. Homelessness can significantly affect students’ success in school: homeless
    students are much less likely to graduate. Homeless students experience greater
    mobility between schools as well as chronic absenteeism, which can interrupt their
    education and are associated with lower school achievement and a higher risk of
    dropping out. Leaders at all levels can benefit from better understanding this
    challenge and how we serve such students.'

Veterans Homelessness and Employment:
  Sprints: 2017 Sprint 1 (ED HUD VA)
  Full Title: Veterans Homelessness and Employment
  Agency: U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
  Challenge: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is focused on ensuring that we
    end homelessness for our veterans and support them in the most effective way possible.
  Background: "Veteran homelessness is a multi-faceted problem requiring a diverse
    set of solutions. Veterans interact with many organizations and service providers
    to address career transition, health, and other challenges These groups are not
    always coordinated, and also leave gaps in needed resources. For example: Veterans
    lack support for translating military skills and training to sustained post-military
    employment to help them more effectively transition and thrive in civilian life;
    numerous organizations, including VA and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs),
    interface with veterans and yet lack a unified communication platform, leaving
    the burden of organizing and coordinating information on the veteran experiencing
    homelessness; even when a veteran is given resources for temporary housing; barriers
    to basic, practical needs such as a ride to and from a medical appointment or
    a job interview prevent veterans from regaining their independence.\L In order
    to optimize the veteran’s experience and outcomes, veterans need technology tools
    that will help them to connect with jobs that are suited to their individual strengths
    and specific skills, and connect with transportation to critical appointments
    such as job interviews. These tools would help veterans to feel supported by the
    VA and VA partners as they are better able to provide access to the critical resources
    veterans need."

Making federal grants data user-friendly for local leaders:
  Sprints: 2017 Sprint 2 (Census OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Making federal grants data user-friendly for local leaders
  Agency: Office of Management and Budget,U.S. Department of the Treasury
  Challenge: Create digital tools for Federal financial assistance that help local
    leaders navigate and manage Federal grants.
  Background: State, local, and tribal governments, nonprofits, and universities complain
    that, despite the plethora of public data available, it can be dif cult to navigate
    information about federal programs, funding opportunities, and current awards
    to nd the best available resources to address their most pressing challenges.
    This is especially true for lower capacity entities who may not have as much experience
    partnering with the Federal government. Further, to manage and report on these
    awards, these organizations must interface with multiple Federal reporting requirements
    and systems, creating expensive administrative burden. The results of the DATA
    Act section 5 pilot indicate that burden is reduced when recipients are required
    to interact with fewer systems to partner with the Federal government, and when
    identical data can be entered once and reused as necessary.
  Impact: The Federal government spends more than $700 billion annually
    on Federal financial assistance, equivalent to 20% of the Federal budget and 5%
    of the United States gross domestic product. There are more than 40,000 organizations
    across the country that rely on Federal financial assistance, which often accounts
    for 20-30% of a state or local government’s revenue. Federal grants support everything
    from local re ghters, police of cers, elementary schools, buses, bridges, housing,
    school lunches, community health centers, research to cure cancer or invent technology,
    and even the pipes we use to drink water or ush toilets. Unfortunately, while
    there are multiple Federal data sets and websites about these resources available
    to the public, not all local leaders are able to nd and access the resources that
    could most bene t their communities. Further, these resources are managed in a
    siloed way, authorized ad hoc over time by Congress, and administered by separate
    departments within agencies, with separate goals and requirements. For a single
    local government managing multiple awards, the required reporting processes add
    up. This fragmentation results in missed opportunities for alignment among complimentary
    Federal programs. Our taxpayer dollars could go much further faster if those who
    use them could access and manage them more seamlessly.
  Vision: Leaders across America maximize return on Federal investments
    by navigating quickly to the resources best positioned to help them solve their
    toughest challenges, and access tools to ef ciently manage this partnership.

Engaging communities in the Census:
  Sprints: 2017 Sprint 2 (Census OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Engaging communities in the Census
  Agency: U.S. Census Bureau
  Challenge: Create digital tools that enable individuals and communities to see and
    experience the value of the Census in order to increase participation in the Census
  Background: Every decade, in years ending in “0,” the U.S. Census Bureau conducts
    its Decennial Census, apportioning representation in the U.S. House of Representatives,
    as well as federal funds for critical infrastructure and services such as housing,
    highways, schools, hospitals, and scores of programs that are vital to the health
    and welfare of the U.S. population and economy.In addition to the Decennial Census,
    the U.S. Census Bureau conducts other critical surveys such as the Economic Census
    and the American Community Survey, which can help businesses do their planning,
    and measure the health of our economy and places. It is critical that all those
    living in the U.S. participate in the Census. It is therefore vital that people
    know the impact that Census has on their lives, families, communities, and societies.
    Yet certain groups have been undercounted at disproportionately high rates, including
    rural communities, children, and those experiencing homelessness. We are bringing
    together teams of partners from across industries and sectors to ideate new technology
    platforms and solutions that will drive participation nationwide.
  Impact: When people and businesses participate in the Census,
    they further drive its value by ensuring a complete count. Having an accurate
    count then ensures the fair distribution of federal spending and apportionment
    of congressional seats. When segments of the population are undercounted, it results
    in fewer resources allocated, imprecise policy recommendations, and less congressional
    representation for those communities. The 2020 Census will also be the first to
    have an online response option, presenting new challenges with those who aren’t
    digitally connected, but also opening up new opportunities for creative solutions.
  Vision: People living in America know the impact of the Census
    on their lives, family, community and society, and are therefore are driven to
    participate. Learning how to take the Census will be as easy as going to vote.gov.

Promoting Access to and Interest in STEM Fields:
  Sprints: 2018 Sprint 1 (ED DOL OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Promoting Access to and Interest in STEM Fields
  Agency: U.S. Department of Education
  Challenge: Develop tools for parents and students that promote students' interest
    in STEM and empower them to pursue STEM education locally.
  Background: 'Today, too many of our Nation’s K-12 and postsecondary students lack
    access to high quality STEM education, and thus are at risk of being shut out
    from some of the most attractive job options in the growing United States economy.
    Courses in Computer Science are especially scarce in too many schools and communities,
    despite the job opportunities that these skills create. Nearly 40 percent of high
    schools do not offer physics and 60 percent of high schools do not offer computer
    programming. Of the nearly 17,000 high schools that were accredited to offer Advanced
    Placement exams in 2015, only 18 percent were accredited to teach Advanced Placement
    Computer Science (AP-CS). Minorities and students in rural communities often have
    even less access to Computer Science education. Nationwide, only 34 percent of
    African American students and 30 percent of rural high school students have access
    to a Computer Science class. Furthermore, even where classes are offered, there
    is a serious gender gap: less than a quarter of the students who took the AP-CS
    A exam nationally in 2016 were girls.'
  Impact: With the growing role of technology in driving the American
    economy, many jobs increasingly require skills in science, technology, engineering,
    and mathematics (STEM) — including, in particular, Computer Science. These skills
    open the door to jobs, strengthening the backbone of American ingenuity, driving
    solutions to complex problems across industries, and improving lives around the
    world. As part of the Administration’s commitment to supporting American workers
    and increasing economic growth and prosperity, it is critical that we equip America’s
    young people with relevant knowledge and skills that will enable them to compete
    and excel in STEM fields.
  Vision: Students and families are excited about what a STEM
    education can mean for them and have the information and resources they need to
    translate enthusiasm into skill-building. Digital tools to solve this problem
    could focus on STEM (including computer science) offerings in communities across
    the country at the K-12 and postsecondary level.

Helping States Develop Education Report Cards:
  Sprints: 2018 Sprint 1 (ED DOL OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Helping States Develop Education Report Cards
  Agency: U.S. Department of Education
  Challenge: Develop parent-friendly, scalable approaches to communicating data about
    public schools that drive insight and engagement—and meet the requirements of
    a recent federal law.
  Background: 'The Every Student Succeeds Act—a landmark federal education law passed
    in 2015— requires states to make an estimated 2,107 data points about their public
    school systems accessible to parents. In response, states are looking to provide
    this information through digital “report cards.” These websites would give parents
    an interface for navigating important data about schools in their state, including
    per-student spending, test results, and more. Developing these will be a challenge:
    government tends to lack digital services expertise that would help ensure their
    solutions align with best practices around data visualization and human-centered
    design. The requirements of federal law and those around student privacy complicate
    the task, increasing the risk that parents end up with clunky tools that confuse
    rather than illuminate.'
  Why this problem matters: 'The Every Student Succeeds Act has catalyzed nation-wide
    interest in new approaches to making data about schools transparent and accessible.
    A state-led wave of report card solutions is coming, one that will transform how
    families across the country learn about the schools in their neighborhood, and
    this is your opportunity to help shape a movement. VISION: Digital tools that
    present this data in user-friendly and engaging ways will give states better tools
    and strategies for tackling data reporting requirements, resulting in more accessible
    information for families and their advocates as they navigate students’ options
    for a great education.'
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Digital tools that present this data in user-friendly

Using AI to Connect Veterans with Registered Apprenticeships:
  Sprints: 2018 Sprint 1 (ED DOL OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Using AI to Connect Veterans with Registered Apprenticeships
  Agency: U.S. Department of Labor
  Challenge: Develop tools that use artificial intelligence algorithms or natural
    language processing technology to match veterans to registered apprenticeship
    programs.
  Background: Veterans have difficulty translating their military skills to civilian
    skills. This is both a relevancy problem (they don’t know how their military skills
    relate to civilian skills) and a communication problem (they don’t know how to
    describe their military skills into civilian terms). As a result, veterans are
    matched to – and subsequently employed in – jobs that do not fully utilize their
    skills.
  Why this problem matters: DOL places a priority on preparing and providing veterans
    with career opportunities. Both DOL and the Administration also place a priority
    on providing high quality job training through registered apprenticeships (for
    example - a recent Executive Order directed expansion of apprenticeships). By
    showing the relationship between specific military skills to related civilian
    skills, digital tools can help veterans understand what civilian jobs and registered
    apprenticeship programs match to their military skills, helping them to succeed
    in the workforce.

Increasing Government Accountability by Connecting Federal Spending and Performance Data:
  Sprints: 2018 Sprint 1 (ED DOL OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Increasing Government Accountability by Connecting Federal Spending
    and Performance Data
  Agency: Office of Management and Budget,U.S. Department of the Treasury
  Challenge: Develop public facing tools that link federal spending and performance
    (or outcome) data to provide comprehensive insight into the use of federal taxpayer
    dollars across programs.
  Background: The Federal government has extensive data that currently exists in silos.
    Agencies maintain data about their programs, open data sources maintain various
    elements of meta data, and government-wide systems like Performance.gov and USASpending.gov
    hold data about specific areas of Federal operations. Although the Federal government
    has made strides with improving accountability and transparency, linking these
    data sets together would tell a holistic story of federal financial management.
  Why this problem matters: In 2017, the Federal government spent over $3 trillion
    dollars in financial assistance. While USASpending.gov provides access to federal
    spending data at lower levels of granularity, there is still an opportunity to
    enhance transparency and show the American public how programs are performing
    with tax payer dollars. With an increase in spending in high impact areas such
    as disaster relief, there is public interest in more accountability and transparency
    into federal spending. Linking federal spending and performance in high impact
    areas using government open data can enhance data transparency, promote economic
    growth and research, and improve services to the American public. The President’s
    Management Agenda also places a priority on leveraging data as a strategic asset
    to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate
    oversight, and promote transparency.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Connect Federal financial and performance data in high
    impact areas such as disaster relief, infrastructure, and financial assistance,
    allowing the American public to track progress in key areas, unlock economic opportunities,
    and expand research capabilities.

Improving Access to and Management of Federal Grants:
  Sprints: 2018 Sprint 1 (ED DOL OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Improving Access to and Management of Federal Grants
  Agency: Office of Management and Budget,U.S. Department of the Treasury
  Challenge: Develop tools that expand on existing systems to help grant recipients
    manage the entire grants lifecycle, helping grant managers and recipients search
    for opportunities, streamline reporting, and assess risks.
  Background: Grant managers—including those that administer funds from inside the
    Federal Government and those from external organizations that receive Federal
    funds—report spending 40% of their time using antiquated processes to monitor
    compliance instead of data and analytics to monitor results. The organizations
    that receive Federal grant funds—from states, localities, and tribes to schools
    and nonprofits—report that the current process is overly burdensome and takes
    away from the missions they are working to deliver. Furthermore, local governments
    struggle to plan for future opportunities while balancing reporting requirements
    and managing overall risks.
  Why this problem matters: Approximately $700 billion is invested annually through
    more than 1,800 diverse Federal grant programs listed on CFDA.gov. These funds
    support activities that touch every American, such as medical research, education,
    transportation infrastructure, workforce initiatives, economic development, and
    services for veterans. Streamlining access to grants opportunities, with reporting
    requirements and risk assessments, will reduce burdensome compliance activities
    and fuel economic growth, focusing more on results for the American taxpayer (a
    Priority of the President’s Management Agenda).
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Grant recipients and agencies spend less time on administrative
    compliance and can redirect resources to achieving program results.

Helping Tribal, State, and Local Governments with Local Address Data Collection:
  Sprints: 2018 Sprint 1 (ED DOL OMB/Treasury)
  Full Title: Helping Tribal, State, and Local Governments with Local Address Data
    Collection
  Agency: U.S. Census Bureau,U.S. Department of Transportation
  Challenge: 'Develop resources that help tribal, state, and local governments to
    create and maintain open address point data. These resources might include: •
    Tools that can be used in the field and in the office to collect, geocode, validate,
    maintain and share data • “Seed” data that can serve as a starting point for data
    collection and can be shared openly (address lists, address point data, parcel
    data, structure outlines) • Linkages to open data sharing platforms'
  Background: Many state and local governments do not have a database of addresses
    with geospatial coordinates (also known as address point data), which is critical
    for high priority issues like emergency response. In some cases, where the governments
    have address point data, it is not openly available due to propriety or legal
    constraints. Many state and local governments do not have the resources to plan,
    implement, and maintain address point data collection activities. Resources needed
    to overcome data collection challenges include software tools, starter data, human
    capital, collection processes and guidelines, and data system integration.
  Why this problem matters: Tribal, state, and local address point data are critical
    to all levels of government. During catastrophic events such as hurricanes and
    wild fires, residences and businesses cannot be located using traditional means
    of address navigation since the structures, street signs, and landmarks no longer
    exist. An easily accessible data base of reliable, accurate, and uniform/standardized
    address point data can meet the immediate needs of emergency responders and communities
    in crisis. A complete address data base is also needed to accurately count citizens
    through censuses and surveys in order for governments to receive their share of
    federal funds and be accurately represented. For example, in 2015, Census Bureau
    data was used to distribute more than $675 billion in funds. Address data is also
    critical for the Master Address File (MAF) used for the decennial census and ongoing
    surveys. For the Department of Transportation (DOT), complete, accurate, and up-to-date
    addresses with location data is critical to transportation safety and the National
    911 Program, which envisions an emergency response system that best serves the
    public, providing immediate help in all emergency situations. Mail delivery, real
    estate and land use decisions, and public health tracking also depend on address
    point data. The Census Bureau and DOT are committed to improving data completeness,
    accuracy and currency, which are key to successful development of a National Address
    Database (NAD) as a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA).
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Outcomes from The Opportunity Project provide the momentum
    needed for tribal, state, and local governments to begin to fill in address point
    data gaps across the nation and to share the data openly, and help to share best
    practices for workflows and processes, including metadata

    training, and even healthcare. His community is diverse – it’s a mix of English-speaking,
    established residents as well as New Americans who are less proficient English
    and with engaging their government. Anthony and his neighbors would benefit from
    tools that make it easier to talk about how their community is disconnected from
    opportunity, so they can help their local officials understand the “whole picture”
    about opportunity in his community. As a leader in his community, he’s involved
    with a number of volunteer groups that are helping their neighbors get around
    and make their community safer. He’s heard about transportation projects that
    are being proposed by his government, but he and his neighbors don’t have data
    to bring to the table when they’re meeting with their government officials. For
    him, it’s not just about access to jobs, training, and healthcare. There are safety
    issues in his community – his neighbors feel like the streets are too dangerous
    for getting around, and crime is prevalent. Plus, his neighbors are concerned
    about their environment. There’s a lot of industrial traffic that cuts through
    his community, not to mention potentially dangerous infrastructure like pipelines
    – neighbors are concerned about their safety. Anthony knows that these safety
    issues are barriers to accessing opportunity, too.

    and success.
  Background: The Department of Education is focused on ensuring that parents, students,
    and policymakers are able to use its publicly available data to take meaningful
    action to improve outcomes.
  Why this problem matters: Certain mobile or disconnected student populations entering
    or reentering the community could greatly benefit from data and resources to support
    their wellbeing and success. Such students and families often lack information
    that is necessary to distinguish between their school options, access services,
    and identify affordable housing near high-quality school and in safe neighborhoods
    that have access to transit and employment.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Students reentering after incarceration would benefit
    from connections to education, skills development, and employment. Foster youth
    would benefit from information regarding educational, financial, health, housing,
    and transportation services. Recently-arrived immigrants (particularly non-English
    speakers) – would benefit from information on their rights, child care, transportation,
    employment, higher education, financial aid opportunities, adult education, and

  Why this problem matters: Within and across school districts and communities there
    are significant disparities in outcomes (e.g. achievement, graduation rate) between

    (e.g. per-pupil expenditures, rigorous coursework, effective teachers). Decision-makers
    (e.g. superintendents, principals, school board members, state departments of
    education), municipal leaders (e.g. mayors, city council members), and parents
    to would benefit from information that could help them understand these inequities
    and/or identify where gaps between groups of students may exist.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: A local superintendent sees that students in a certain
    part of his district do not have the same access to rigorous coursework as those
    in another part and adjusts course offerings by making different decisions around
    human capital and budgeting. A principal sees that her school has far fewer actual
    resources than a school with a similar demographic of students and uses the data
    to make their case to the school board and superintendent for additional resources.
    A parent sees gaps between groups (e.g. English learners and non-English learners)
    of students citywide in access to experienced teachers, investigates and discovers
    that is because there is not enough support given to teachers of ELs so they turnover
    more frequently, and works with the school district and school board to address
    those gaps.
  Target audience / End user: Decision-makers (e.g. superintendents, principals, school
    board members, state departments of education), municipal leaders (e.g. mayors,
    city council members), and parents

Ending Homelessness:
  Sprints: Agency Cohort (2016 Sprint 2/3)
  Full Title: Ending Homelessness
  Agency: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
  Challenge: Develop tools to connect potential landlords with the providers of Rapid
    Rehousing servicess to the homeless.
  Background: The Department of Housing and Urban Development is focused on ensuring
    that we end homelessness and support families and individuals experiencing homelessness
    in the most effective way possible.
  Why this problem matters: Research has shown that for homeless families Rapid Rehousing
    – having the homeless provider pay the rent on an apartment for 6 to 18 months
    and providing intensive services during that time frame – is a far more cost effective
    way to quickly address families in crisis than other methods such as Transitional
    Housing and longer stays in Emergency Shelter. The problem is connecting potential
    landlords with the providers of services to the homeless.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Cynthia and her 1 year old son John have gone to an
    emergency shelter to escape an abusive relationship. Cynthia has not worked since
    her son was born but had previously worked as wait staff. The Emergency Shelter
    had determined that with short term housing assistance and services to connect
    her with child care and helping her locate a job, she could escape her abusive
    situation and live on her own. What the Emergency Shelter needs is an easy way
    to identify available units that Cynthia might be comfortable living, with the
    landlord willing to accept payment from the homeless provider for a specified
    time period.

  Full Title: Accessing Apprenticeships
  Agency: U.S. Department of Labor
  Challenge: Job seekers who are looking for apprenticeship opportunities within their
    communities or in specific areas are currently unable to identify Registered Apprenticeships
    (RA) training/job openings.
  Background: The Department of Labor believes that employers in every industry deserve
    the tools to develop a highly skilled workforce to help their business compete.
    For workers, apprenticeships offer opportunities to earn a salary while learning
    the technical skills necessary to succeed in high-demand careers.
  Why this problem matters: Job seekers who are looking for apprenticeship opportunities
    within their communities or in specific areas are currently unable to identify
    Registered Apprenticeships (RA) training/job openings. Currently, there is an
    Apprenticeship Finder 1.0 which allows job seekers the opportunity to find apprenticeable
    occupations, but it does not specifically show RA programs
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Educators like high school counselors looking to create
    RA opportunity lists as part of a career pathway mechanism. Community colleges
    searching for programs that are currently not registered. Potential employers
    seeking to post potential RA opportunities that would feed into the potential
    job pool.

Promoting Health and Wellbeing Nationwide:
  Sprints: Agency Cohort (2016 Sprint 2/3)
  Full Title: Promoting Health and Wellbeing Nationwide
  Agency: Office of the U.S. Surgeon General,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
  Challenge: Parents and community leaders could benefit from evidence-based tools
    that provide information regarding Emotional Well-Being and cultivate individual
    and community-level EWB.
  Background: The Office of the Surgeon General is focused on promoting health and
    wellbeing nationwide and empowering individuals with information on health.
  Why this problem matters: Emotional Well-Being is defined as one’s ability to overcome
    adversity and/or reach one’s fullest potential, has been shown to increase cognitive
    function, immunity and longevity and has been associated with higher graduation
    rates, productivity, and life satisfaction. Investigators have found that we can
    potentially monitor EWB and related health behaviors/outcomes by examining patterns
    in sleep, social interactions, activity, keywords in search engines, and social
    media messages. Parents and community leaders could benefit from evidence-based
    tools that provide information regarding EWBs and cultivate individual and community-level
    EWB.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Parents looking to move to a specific neighborhood want
    to know how a neighborhood rates in terms of EWB. Local city officials and community
    leaders looking to understanding the challenges to EWB (e.g., lack of sleep, burdensome
    amount of stress, trauma, Adverse Childhood Experiences, etc.) and which tools
    can best be leveraged to best address those challenges (e.g. meditation, mental
    health services, counseling, social connection programs, drug therapies, etc.).
    Advocates and state/federal leaders looking identifying populations that have
    a high likelihood for violence, suicide, trauma and other adverse behaviors related
    to a lack of EWB. This information can help direct resources, including funding,
    to the places where it’s most needed. Policymakers are looking to overlay data
    about other health challenges (e.g., lack of physical activity, poor nutrition,
    high rates of substance abuse, etc.) to identify possible correlations with EWB.
    This will help them develop comprehensive public health policies that address
    the totality of a community’s needs, rather than working in silos.

  Full Title: Connecting Americans to skills and jobs
  Agency: U.S. Department of Labor
  Challenge: Unlocking workforce data can make it easier for Americans who are chronically
    unemployed or underemployed to find and access new training and job opportunities.
  Background: The Department of Labor believes that dynamic, rich data about the workforce
    can better connect Americans and their skills to jobs that need to be filled.
    Unlocking this data can make it easier for Americans who are chronically unemployed
    or underemployed to find and access new training and job opportunities.
  Why this problem matters: Job placement professionals such as vocational caseworkers
    at one-stop shops and community resource centers do not have access to a real-time,
    geographically relevant information to connect their clients to the training and
    job opportunities that fit them best. They rely primarily rely on word-of- mouth
    and or physical walk-throughs of neighborhoods to find job openings to refer their
    clients. This method is neither efficient nor effective at placing individuals
    in positions that are best suited to their needs and skills sets.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Caseworkers needing real-time, geographically relevant
    information to connect their clients to training and job opportunities. Underemployed
    or late-career job seekers looking to close their skill gap and improve their
    wage or skill level. Large-scale employers or HR companies looking to understand
    trending jobs and skills to make better hiring decisions about the future.

Small Town Resource Guide:
  Sprints: Agency Cohort (2016 Sprint 2/3)
  Full Title: Small Town Resource Guide
  Agency: U.S. Department of Agriculture
  Challenge: Many small towns lack the capacity/human capital to take advantage of
    programs (e.g. grants and low cost loans for broadband, health facilities, water
    systems, businesses, housing) for which they are eligible.
  Background: USDA Rural Development helps improve the quality of life for families
    in rural communities through technical assistance and a range of grant and loan
    programs, including for housing, essential community facilities, infrastructure,
    and small business development.
  Why this problem matters: Many small towns lack the capacity/human capital to take
    advantage of programs (e.g. grants and low cost loans for broadband, health facilities,
    water systems, businesses, housing) for which they are eligible. Often times the
    “grant writer” for a rural community is its part-time mayor, who fills out applications
    on her dining room table after work. Recognizing stretched local capacity, community
    leaders and residents would benefit from information regarding available programs
    and funds.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: A volunteer firefighter in St Mary’s county, MD has
    been selling donuts all year to raise funds for a new fire truck. He uses a tool
    to look up his town and types of emergency services. He then sees that his town
    has FAR fewer emergency vehicles than its neighbors, realizes that his town had
    not taken advantage of RD’s grant and loan programs for emergency equipment and
    vehicles, and is better able to allocate local resources.

  Agency: U.S. Department of Agriculture
  Challenge: During the academic year, many students rely on school meals for breakfast
    and lunch. In the summer, students and families seek a reliable alternative, but
    information on summer meals sites is often lacking.
  Background: The Food and Nutrition Service promotes nutrition and food security
    for families nationwide.
  Why this problem matters: During the academic year, many students rely on school
    meals for breakfast and lunch. In the summer, students and families seek a reliable
    alternative, but information on summer meals sites is often lacking.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: The Mayor of town X knows that with summer just around
    the corner, many kids and families who count on school breakfast and lunch during
    the school year will be desperate for alternatives during the summer. Recognizing
    limited capacity in the community to host more than a handful of summer meals
    sites, she wants to be strategic about which nonprofits and organizations she
    engages, based on the number of children they can potentially serve. She would
    benefit from data and digital tools that would help her identify the locations
    in her community with closest proximity to public transportation, highest number
    of families qualifying for free and reduced school lunch, and a host of other
    factors to maximize impact.

Using Geospatial Data to Help People Prepare for Disasters:
  Sprints: Geocohort
  Full Title: Using Geospatial Data to Help People Prepare for Disasters
  Agency: U.S. Department of Homeland Security,Federal Emergency Management Agency
  Challenge: 'Create digital tools that use data to help individuals and community
    leaders gain a better understanding of national and community hazards and threats
    and enable the public to take appropriate preparedness actions. Digital tools
    could leverage geospatial data to: • help identify barriers to preparedness within
    communities; • create innovative engagement platforms such as games that allow
    people to experiment and explore hazards and threats unique to their communities
    in a “low-risk” environment; and • integrate with current preparedness messaging
    to help people, especially younger cohorts, better understand risks and encourage
    preparedness actions.'
  Background: A significant number of young Americans are not aware of the risks they
    face and are not taking meaningful preparedness actions to improve their chance
    of successfully weathering a disaster. Personal and family preparedness can greatly
    impact individuals’ and communities’ ability to successfully and rapidly recover
    should disaster strike. However, in the 2016 National Household Preparedness Survey,
    only 45% of respondents reported having a household emergency plan. Additionally,
    people who consider preparedness part of every life tend to be 65 years of age
    or older, white and male, while people who intend to prepare but have yet to get
    started tend to be 45 years of age or younger, black or Hispanic, and have children
    at home. Furthermore, a 2014 study found that the 46% of the US population who
    fall into the “Not On Their Radar” Preparedness Profile are more likely to be
    18-34 and less likely to own a home. This group of people tend to perceive barriers
    to preparedness like cost, time, and access to information. They are also less
    likely to take significant steps to prepare.
  Why this problem matters: Current research suggests that exposure to preparedness
    messaging shows a significant relationship to taking preparedness action—almost
    doubling the percentage of individuals with an emergency plan (58%) compared to
    those not exposed to preparedness messaging (34%). A major objective of FEMA’s
    strategic effort to build a culture of preparedness across the nation is helping
    people to prepare for disasters. As demonstrated on September 11, 2001, the preparedness
    level of private citizens can weigh heavily on the outcome of an incident, especially
    a no-notice event. On that day, only 5.36% of building occupants who perished
    in the World Trade Center collapse worked below the impact zones. This low mortality
    rate is attributed to the preparedness advancements set in place prior to September
    11, 2001, and led the 9-11 commission to conclude that citizens across the nation
    need to be prepared to maximize their odds of survival should disaster strike.
    Changing attitudes and achieving a true culture of preparedness across the nation
    will require a paradigm shift in how we deliver information, particularly to younger
    Americans.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Through access to data and user friendly digital tools,
    more Americans are aware of the hazards they face and what they can do to protect
    themselves and their families, and take action to get prepared.
  Target audience / End user: Individuals ages 18-34 and influencers within communities,
    to include faith leaders, emergency managers, and leaders of civic organizations.

Harnessing Data and Leveraging Digital Tools to Combat the Opioid Crisis:
  Sprints: Geocohort
  Full Title: Harnessing Data and Leveraging Digital Tools to Combat the Opioid Crisis
  Agency: White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
  Challenge: Create digital tools and data sharing capabilities to support decisions
    across the broad range of stakeholders responding to the opioid crisis, such as
    public health, public safety, law enforcement, community groups, the private sector,
    and individuals.
  Background: Opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose have reached crisis levels in
    the United States. From 1999 to 2016, the number of overdose deaths involving
    opioids increased more than five-fold, from about 8,000 to over 42,000. Both prescription
    and illicit opioids contribute to this trend. The opioid crisis extends beyond
    those suffering from addiction and overdose, to their families and communities.
    For example, the rate of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome increased more than
    five-fold between 2004 and 2014 with rising exposure to opioids before birth.
    Local and state governments struggle to provide opioid treatment and preventive
    services and target law enforcement efforts against the increasing traffic of
    illicit opioids. Meanwhile, opioid addiction removes patients and caregivers from
    the workforce. The White House Council of Economic Advisers recently estimated
    the economic toll of the opioid crisis at $504 billion in 2015, or 2.8 percent
    of GDP.
  Why this problem matters: 'The opioid crisis exerts a tremendous human and economic
    toll on America, and shows no sign of abating. The Administration’s Office of
    Science and Technology Policy established a Fast-Track Action Committee (FTAC),
    which identified critical data gaps that hinder effective decision-making in response
    to the opioid crisis, from the Federal level to state and local governments, to
    community groups and individuals. New digital tools, data integration, and data
    science approaches could address key questions such as: 1. How do geographic location
    and local factors influence opioid misuse and addiction, and the effectiveness
    of prevention and treatment programs based on location? 2. How can data from law
    enforcement, public health, forensic laboratory, and other complementary sources
    be integrated and analyzed to guide real-time response? 3. How do clinical and
    medical coverage policies for pain management, and opioid misuse and addiction,
    influence the landscape of the opioid crisis? 4. What is the geographic and socio-cultural
    context of stigma with opioid misuse and addiction?'
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Holistic data systems provide real-time, large-scale,
    geographically-specific, multivariate data and data-analysis capabilities to guide
    decisions at all levels and reduce the burden of the opioid crisis on communities
    nationwide.

Identifying and Strengthening Civic Environmental Stewardship:
  Sprints: Geocohort
  Full Title: Identifying and Strengthening Civic Environmental Stewardship
  Agency: U.S. Forest Service
  Challenge: Develop tools that visualize and provide access to the patterns, overlaps,
    and gaps in environmental stewardship efforts in order to identify local civic
    groups that support community quality of life and well-being, strengthen community
    resilience and emergency preparedness, and amplify positive outcomes.
  Background: Worldwide and across the United States, cities and towns are grappling
    with aging infrastructure, fluctuating populations, and a changing climate. Public
    agencies cannot address these issues alone, which has led to involving a growing
    network of civic stewardship organizations and volunteers to take care of the
    city. Civic stewards ranging from NGOs to grassroots groups of neighbors engage
    in conservation, management, monitoring, education, advocacy, and transformation
    of local environments – through activities like forest restoration, storm water
    management, community gardening, and more. But better tools are needed to identify
    and track these groups, which often can be informal and hard to find. Although
    public maps show green infrastructure and open space (e.g. forests, parks, trees,
    gardens), there is no comprehensive map showing social infrastructure, like the
    civic groups that care for--or steward--these sites in U.S. cities. Over the past
    decade, USDA Forest Service research has found that civic stewardship groups focused
    on different issues (e.g., tree care, clean water) can be working in the same
    neighborhood, yet unaware of each other. Also, we have found that some groups
    may be working on similar issues, but in different places and without coordination.
    In order for stewards to overcome this isolation and maximize the potential for
    productive collaboration, communities need digital resources to locate and connect
    stewardship groups, as well as community leaders and interested residents, across
    an entire town, city, or region.
  Why this problem matters: Communities need maps of social infrastructure because
    civic groups are a crucial component of governing a city’s environment. Public
    agencies know which lands they manage and tax maps document private property ownership,
    but civic groups that engage in stewardship can often be more difficult to identify
    and locate. Research has found that civic stewardship groups focused on different
    issues (e.g., tree care, clean water) can be working in the same neighborhood,
    yet unaware of each other. Some groups may be working on similar issues, but in
    different places and without coordination. In order for stewards to overcome this
    isolation and maximize the potential for productive collaboration, communities
    need digital resources to locate and connect stewardship groups, as well as community
    leaders and interested residents, across an entire town, city, or region. To help
    solve this problem, the USDA Forest Service’s Stewardship Mapping and Assessment
    Project (STEW-MAP) created a reliable, replicable survey methodology for identifying
    civic stewardship groups’ presence, capacity, geography, and social networks.
    This method has been piloted and prototyped in 12 different locations globally,
    helping to identify thousands of civic stewardship groups. Collaborators with
    expertise in interactive mapping, data visualization, and database development
    can help to fully bring these new datasets to life for end users, providing digital
    resources to stewardship groups that are organized, but lack resources. Digital
    tools can leverage this data for social networking, emphasizing the importance
    of collaboration and flows of knowledge and resources. Tools could also combine
    STEW-MAP data with other publicly-accessible datasets to better understand the
    contributions and impacts organizations are having on the environment at local
    and landscape scales.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Primary data such as STEW-MAP are developed into digital
    tools and applications to visualize, recognize, and harness civic capacity, strengthening
    both our environment and our democracy. By recognizing and connecting the efforts
    of these groups, we gain a better understanding of existing civic capacity, create
    pathways for collaboration, and improve the distribution of resources in a city.

Entrepreneurship:
  Sprints: Workforce
  Full Title: Resources to Unleash American Entrepreneurship
  Agency: White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
  Challenge: Develop tools to empower entrepreneurs and innovation ecosystem builders
    to find and navigate the variety of resources available across the federal government.
  Background: Entrepreneurs create the companies that make up the industries of the
    future, and these companies will in turn recruit and train the workforce of the
    future. Young businesses create nearly all net new jobs in America, and contribute
    to 20% of gross job creation. Science and technology are the foundation for many
    high-growth startups, but companies with capital-intensive research and development
    (R&D) products also face some of the greatest challenges. For America to maintain
    its position as the leader of global innovation, it is imperative that we empower
    entrepreneurs with the support to translate research discovery into the new products
    and services in the marketplace that will make meaningful impact.
  Why this problem matters: Entrepreneurs need flexible tools that allow them to access
    the right resources at the right time.  Yet information about government investment
    in intellectual property, expertise, equipment and facilities, and publicly-available
    resources to support entrepreneurs is spread across government agencies and websites.  Entrepreneurs
    unfamiliar with government may lack knowledge about these resources and have difficulty
    navigating and finding them, posing significant barriers to entry and keeping
    the best minds and ideas from reaching their full potential.  Additionally, resources
    and access to capital are not reaching all Americans evenly.  The best ideas can
    come from anywhere, but 80% of all venture capital (VC) investment has been concentrated
    in just three states, and in 2016, only 1% of VC dollars went to African-American
    and Latino founders, and less than 2% went to female founders. Ensuring that access
    to resources and capital are not relegated to a few regions but to all Americans
    is critical to creating a robust and dynamic workforce and inclusive growth, and
    ensuring the benefits of entrepreneurship not only accrue nationwide, not just
    in America’s largest cities.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Entrepreneurs are able to easily find and access opportunities
    for funding, expertise, equipment and facilities, and other resources, resulting
    in more and more inclusive R&D entrepreneurship.

  Full Title: Helping the American Workforce Leverage Multiple Pathways for Career
    Growth
  Agency: U.S. Department of Education
  Challenge: Create digital tools that help American workers to consider and take
    advantage of the multiple pathways available to find or advance in careers. Tools
    could 1)make multiple pathways to career success more attractive by helping people
    envision them as exciting and prestigious, and/or 2) help to make data on these
    opportunities user friendly and discoverable by American workers.
  Background: To many Americans ,earning a 4-year university degree is held up as
    the most attractive, prestigious or only path toward a successful career. Yet,
    educational institutions, companies, unions, and other entities are increasingly
    creating multiple, alternative pathways to careers, including apprenticeships,
    secondary career and technical education programs, community college degree and
    certificate programs, boot camps, industry certificates, combinations of the above,
    and new programs that have not yet been invented. These programs unfairly lack
    the prestige of a college degree, when they often could link to a college degree,
    possibly paid for by an employer. This is in part because for the past several
    decades, American higher education and workforce development has focused on encouraging
    high school students to attend college after graduation. In contrast, in countries
    like Germany and Switzerland, career and technical education, including apprenticeships,
    is highly prestigious in society and culture. While college can be very beneficial
    for many people, it ignores a large swath of Americans who don't necessarily want
    to attend college right after school, don't want to accrue tens of thousands of
    dollars in student loan debt, or who simply want to enter the workforce immediately
    after graduation. To realize the true potential of the American workforce, students
    need to be fully aware of all pathways to careers. Educational institutions, companies,
    unions, and other organizations need to market them as attractive, prestigious,
    and cost-effective career paths for young people. In short, multiple pathways
    need to be easier to find.
  Why this problem matters: The American workforce is missing out on many potential
    educational options to launch or advance careers and develop talent. We need digital
    tools to help people understand and discover this increasingly important sector
    of both the economy and the education space. However, finding and assessing these
    programs isn't easy. People may not even know where to begin looking, and if they
    were to search online, data is scattered across websites and not easily discoverable.
    Some come from the private sector; others are administered by state and local
    governments, companies, or federal government. As a result, American workers and
    employers are missing out on valuable opportunities that could help them to launch
    or advance successful careers.

  Background: The American dream is fading. Almost all children born in 1940 earned
    more than their parents, but the same was true for only half of children born
    in the 1980s. The decline in mobility is related to growing regional inequality.
    In a reversal of trends of the 20th century, regional income inequality has grown
    in the 2000s, making a person's place of birth an increasingly powerful predictor
    of their future income. The Opportunity Zone provision of the 2017 Tax Cut and
    Jobs Act created an incentive to invest in select low-income communities and is
    the core of a major effort to bring investment and opportunity to communities
    and is the core of a major effort to bring investment and opportunity to communities
    bypassed by recent econmic growth. To promote equality of opportunity across the
    US, we need data and tools to connect investors to the Opportunity Zones where
    their dollars will do the most good. Private sector developers can use their talents
    to bring together multiple sources of public data, as well as private data, to
    create new data products that enable investment in overlooked places.
  Why this problem matters: Opportunity Zones are a promising way to revitalize low-income
    communities and bring jobs to local residents.  But this can only occur if investors
    match their capital with the right people and places.  Many low-income communities
    selected to be Opportunity Zones have few resources to market themselves to investors.
    A community may have easy access to transportation infrastructure, low-cost real
    estate, a well-trained workforce, and natural resources, but lack the means to
    document these assets and bring them to the attention of investors. Investors,
    on the other hand, may tend to flock to the most well-known areas for promising
    investment projects and overlook communities with under-studied and under-appreciated
    potential.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: Through better access to consolidated data, more investors,
    entrepreneurs, and community leaders will discover opportunities for economic
    development in overlooked Opportunity Zones.

Talent Discovery:
  Sprints: Workforce
  Full Title: Modernizing Talent Discovery for High Growth Entreprenership
  Agency: U.S. Economic Development Administration
  Challenge: Create digital tools or open sourced data to transform talent discovery,
    matching, and retention in mid-size cities across the country, to help them achieve
    innovation and regional economic growth.
  Background: Knowledge, technology, and innovation are the engines of our economy
    -- without them, regions and the economy as a whole would fail to grow.  Over
    the last 20 years, economic and technological forces have shifted the American
    economic landscape from a manufacturing and agricultural economy to a knowledge-based
    economy, making knowledge even more important to the future of the workforce and
    economic growth. To drive business innovation and productive regional economies,
    communities across the U.S. need intellectual capital, but there is an increasing
    geographic divide in talent.  Large cities like Boston, New York, and San Francisco
    have seen a decade of entrepreneurship growth and increasing capital investment,
    and boast a burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystem of business incubators, accelerators,
    and high-growth companies. But mid-sized cities (with 250,000-1 million residents)
    across the U.S. are just starting to experience similar activity. In these places
    where talent pools are less concentrated and more nascent, discovering the right
    talent is a major barrier for high-growth companies looking to launch and scale.
    New companies and entrepreneurs often lack the resources, time, and knowledge
    in talent search to identify and recruit skilled workers.
  Why this problem matters: To increase their capacity for innovation and growth,
    mid-size cities must find new ways to discover, match, and retain talent so that
    local companies can grow and contribute to a competitive regional economy. Investors,
    entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurial support organizations need tools that will
    help them to identify and match existing talent with high growth companies. This
    is critical to modernizing talent discovery and leveraging human capital for the
    knowledge-based economy of the future.
  Vision for sprint outcomes: user friendly digital tools or datasets that community
    leaders can leverage to discover talent and connect people with economic opportunities
    by geographic region.
  Target audience / End user: Entrepreneurs, entrepreneur support organizations (ESOs),
    incubators, accelerators, seed funds, state and local leaders, and growth companies
    in rural and mid-sized cities where talent pools are less concentrated or nascent.
