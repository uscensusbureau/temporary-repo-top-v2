# used here for the "how it works" section
explanation:
  title: How It Works
  # two column layout of text; the text layout is wide; items build left to right and top to bottom, meaning the first item listed will be left aligned, the next will be next to it (in the right column), the third will be in a new row below, left aligned under the first item, and so on.
  #         |    
  #    1    |    2
  #  ---------------
  #    3    |    4
  #         |    
  # This layout can be used for two side-by-side pieces of text or for a "quad" style layout. If items should be numbered, follow this pattern. If no numbers are needed, the "number" item should marked false
